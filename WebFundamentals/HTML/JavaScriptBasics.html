          <h4>JavaScript Basics</h4>
          <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform,
          object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular
          for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language
          allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of
          different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment
          (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of
          these environments to provide programmatic control over them.

              <a href="">Variable Declaration</a>
              JavaScript variables are containers
              for storin g data values - imagrn ' e a cup you fill with
              cofi’ee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.
              All I av' p variables must be identified with unique names.
              These unique names are called identifiers. var x;
            </p>

            <a href="">Variable Assignments</a>
            Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our
            cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value
            to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.
            var x = 10;
            </p>

            <a href="">Data Type</a>
            Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on
            variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types
            that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - true. or false; null -
            null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; Suing - "Coding Dojo
            Rocks! Array - [l , ‘Coding‘, 2, 'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name:
            ‘Jane’, last_name: 'Doc‘}
            </p>
          </li>

            <a href="">Conditionals</a>
            Conditionals When you write code, you want to perform different
            actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks
            based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use
            conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are
            the following conditional statements: if a specified condition is
            true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new
            condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute
            this block of code;
            </p>

            <a href="">Loops</a>
            There are many different kinds of loops in every programming l
            anguage, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will
            repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a
            mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.
            Thats a loop!
          </li>

            <a href="">Functions</a>
            Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our
            function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of
            instructions. As an exmnple imag ine we are putting together a desk
            fi'om Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started,
            first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table
            the right way up. Done! We finish ed our instructions. Sadly there
            are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over
            and over again.
